  <span class="faqQ">What does xarxa mean? And why isn't it capitalized?</span>
  <br />
 <span class="faqA"> This is the wiktionary entry for xarxa:<br />
  <img src="http://i.imgur.com/OIHnq.png" /><br />
  Why Catalan? And shouldn't it technically be xarxes? I have no idea why I chose the Catalan definition. It's not xarxes because it looks an awful lot like Xerxes. It is not capitalized because not capitalizing is very trendy. And I like being trendy.</span>
  <br /> <br />
   <span class="faqQ">How do you pronounce xarxa?</span>
  <br />
 <span class="faqA">Technically xarxa is pronounced as SHAR-ra-sha. But you're welcome to pronounce it however you like.</span>
  <br /> <br />
   <span class="faqQ">Why is nothing showing up when I search for a course?</span>
  <br />
 <span class="faqA">You're probably not using the latest versions of either Firefox/Chrome/Safari/Opera or god forbid, you're using IE.</span>
 <br /> <br />
   <span class="faqQ">Why is nothing happening when I try to search for a course?</span>
  <br />
 <span class="faqA">You've probably turned Javascript off.</span>
 <br /> <br />
   <span class="faqQ">Everything is very laggy, and it's very hard to do anything.. Do you have a 'simpler' version of the results?</span>
  <br />
 <span class="faqA">Try using a faster browser such as Chrome or Opera as they're both better at handling javascript. If that's not possible, I will add a 'simplified' version of the results in the future.</span>
 <br /> <br />
   <span class="faqQ">How did you do xxxxx?</span>
  <br />
 <span class="faqA">E-Mail me and ask! I'd be glad to share the little amount of knowledge I have.</span>
 <br /> <br />
   <span class="faqQ">This is great! But I want McGill to have this on their website...</span>
  <br />
 <span class="faqA">If this becomes very popular, we can send emails to McGill requesting them to change that part of their website.</span>
  <br /> <br />
   <span class="faqQ">This coding is terrible and it offends me as a programmer.</span>
  <br />
 <span class="faqA">I haven't had a lot of formal training in programming, especially in web languages. Please tell me how much I suck through email.</span>
  <br /> <br />
   <span class="faqQ">I want this for my (inferior) university that's not McGill, can you do it?</span>
  <br />
 <span class="faqA">Maybe, if there's enough demand and I have a lot of free time.</span>
 <br /> <br />
   <span class="faqQ">Who are you?</span>
  <br />
 <span class="faqA">Currently I'm a U1 science student in McGill, majoring in Biology & Compsci. I program as a hobby and sometimes a source of income. Yeah I'm a total geek.</span>
