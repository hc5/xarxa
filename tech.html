  For rendering the charts I'm using a modfied version of <a href="http://thejit.org/">JIT(Javascript Infovis Toolkit)</a>. I've modfied a few things to suit my needs for this, and added a few things that the API was missing. The toolkit mainly relies on canvas to do its work, which is why this only works on the latest versions of Chrome/Firefox/Opera/Safari, and probably IE 9 when it comes out.
  <br />
  <br />
  I'm using mysql to store all the courses and their relationships. The course info was gotten through a crawler I wrote in php that went through McGill's course catalogue. Every search result is cached serverside after the first search, so I guess eventually this site will become static.
  <br />
  <br />
  The 'autofill' function was really just a hack involving a dynamically placed 'select' element, and AJAX to fetch the results to the autofill.
  <br /><br />
  The color picking tool in options is implemented with the JQuery plugin <a href="http://acko.net/dev/farbtastic">Farbtastic</a>.
  <br /><br />
 All the animations and AJAX were implemented with JQuery.
 <br /><br />
 The option settings were saved with the HTML5 localStorage. Since any browser that supports canvas will support localStorage, I won't have to worry about incompatibility issues.
 <br /><br />
 This site doesn't use any Flash elements, so I guess it will work on the iPhone/iPad, not sure about the performance though, as I have never tested it on the mobile devices.
