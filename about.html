    No, really.<br />
    I noticed how terrible McGill is at actually providing information for the courses when I was picking my own courses, so I decided to just rewrite the system and make it better.<br /><br />
    With xarxa you can enter a course you're considering taking in the future, or hell, you've already taken but realized that it wasn't needed for your degree (possibly because of being misinformed by McGill's website).<br /><br />
    xarxa will then search through its database and output a tree from the course that you've entered.<br /><br />
    On the left of the root you will see the prerequisites leading up to the course you searched. Note that not all the prereqs will be used. For some courses there's are alternate routes leading up to it, in this case all the routes will be displayed in the tree. Also note that CO REQUISITES are not displayed, and you should always click on each course to see its detailed information.
    <br /><br />
    On the right of the root you will see courses that will use the course that you've searched as a prerequisite. This does not mean you are able to take the courses on the right immediately, but rather, taking that course will help you get closer to the courses on the right. For each course on the right, clicking on them will further expand the tree until it can no longer be expanded. Clicking on the root node will expand the entire right side by one step (this can become very memory consuming on your computer and you shouldn't do it after 2-3 steps are loaded already.
    <br /><br />
    You can change the color scheme of the entire thing by going to the Options and changing it from there.
    <br /><br />
    If there's a bug with the webapp, or something annoys you or you're having a bad day because of how terrible course selection is, you can always shoot an email my way at yang.zhou@live.ca
